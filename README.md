# CardGame
The game is played with a deck of cards with comical illustrations of eight different types of beans (some more scarce than others), which two players place cards in chains, trade the cards and sell the chains in order to raise money. The player obtains cards of all different types randomly from the deck, and so must engage in trade with the other player to be successful. The cards have 8 different faces corresponding to different types of Beans (see Table below). The goal of the game is to chain-up the cards of same bean to gain coins. The player with the most coins at the end wins. The chains for the cards are formed by each player for all to see and there are a maximum of either two or three chains at any point per player. Each chain can only be formed with a single type of Bean. Each player is dealt a hand of five cards to start and the remaining cards form a draw deck. The rule is that cards in a playerâ€™s hand need to be kept sorted. Cards will be placed on a discard pile during the game. Cards in the hand are kept hidden. Cards in trading areas and chains are visible to all players. The discard pile is face up, but only the top card is visible
